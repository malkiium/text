# GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)

## Overview

A GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a specialized processor designed to accelerate graphics rendering. It is essential for gaming, video editing, 3D rendering, and AI applications.

## Key Characteristics

- **Parallel Processing**: Can handle thousands of tasks simultaneously.
- **Dedicated Video Memory (VRAM)**: Stores textures, frame buffers, and other graphical data.
- **Essential for High-Performance Computing**: Used in AI, machine learning, and scientific simulations.

## How GPU is Used

1. **Gaming**: Renders high-resolution textures and complex 3D environments.
2. **Content Creation**: Speeds up video editing, animation, and 3D modeling.
3. **AI & Machine Learning**: Used for neural network training and deep learning.
4. **Cryptocurrency Mining**: Some GPUs are optimized for blockchain computations.
5. **Virtual Reality (VR)**: Provides the necessary power for immersive experiences.
6. **High-Performance Computing**: Assists in simulations and scientific research.

## Types of GPUs

- **Integrated GPU**: Built into the CPU, suitable for basic tasks.
- **Dedicated GPU**: A separate card offering higher performance.
- **Workstation GPU**: Designed for professional applications like CAD and 3D rendering.
