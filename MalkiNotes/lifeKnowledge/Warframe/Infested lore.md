[[Warframe lore]]
# **Infested**

- A deadly, parasitic force created from the Orokin’s failed experiments.
- Originated from the “Technocyte” virus, capable of infecting both organic and synthetic matter.
- Spread across the Origin System, corrupting and mutating everything in its path.
- Initially created as a weapon by the Orokin, it became uncontrollable.
- Became a primary threat to both the Orokin and the Tenno during the Old War.

# **Infestation Origin**

- The Infestation was born from Orokin experiments in genetic manipulation.
- Initially, the Technocyte virus was intended to be used as a weapon against the Sentients.
- The Orokin unleashed the virus, but it rapidly grew uncontrollable, mutating beyond their control.
- The virus infects both living organisms and machinery, merging the two in a grotesque fashion.
- The Orokin sought to contain and eradicate it but were unable to stop its spread.

# **The Technocyte Virus**

- The Technocyte virus is the core of the Infestation, capable of infecting any living being or synthetic system.
- Once introduced into a host, the virus rapidly mutates the organism, turning it into a monstrous, hive-minded creature.
- The virus warps the infected’s mind, erasing individuality and replacing it with a collective consciousness.
- It spreads quickly through contact, often turning entire colonies into Infested husks.

# **Infestation and the Orokin**

- The Orokin created the Infestation as a potential weapon but failed to control it.
- They experimented on their own people, turning them into the first Infested, hoping to harness the virus’s power.
- The Infestation rapidly overwhelmed the Orokin in their search for control, becoming their undoing.
- Some Orokin sought to harness the Infestation, such as the Entrati, but their efforts led to corruption and mutation.
- The Infested ravaged Orokin outposts and cities, forcing the Empire to retreat or perish.

# **Infested Biology**

- The Infested take on various forms, including monsters, humanoid creatures, and bio-mechanical horrors.
- It uses a hive-mind structure, with the main consciousness controlling the collective actions of its infected minions.
- Infested creatures are often deformed and monstrous, their bodies twisted by the Technocyte virus.
- The virus can also infect machinery, resulting in horrific biomechanical hybrids like the Infested MOA and other constructs.
- The Infestation can spread across entire ecosystems, overtaking both organic and mechanical life forms.

# **Infestation as a Threat**

- The Infested are highly resilient, capable of surviving in harsh environments and spreading quickly.
- They serve as a major threat to both the Orokin and Tenno, attacking without mercy.
- Infested outbreaks often result in entire colonies being consumed or destroyed.
- The Tenno, though powerful, had to fight to contain and contain the Infested during the Old War.
- Their relentless spread led to the creation of the Warframes, designed specifically to combat them.

# **The Infestation and Deimos**

- Deimos, a moon of Mars, became a major site for Infested activity, particularly the Entrati family’s experiments.
- The Infestation on Deimos fused with the Entrati’s technology, creating a horrific ecosystem of bio-mechanical monstrosities.
- The Entrati’s obsession with the Infestation led to their eventual mutations, linking them to the very creatures they studied.
- Deimos has become a dark, infested world where the line between technology and the Infestation is blurred.

# **Infested Legacy**

- The Infestation is not just a biological plague, but a spiritual and psychological horror.
- It represents the Orokin’s failed hubris and their inability to control what they created.
- Despite being defeated in some areas, the Infestation continues to spread across the Origin System.
- Some Tenno and factions continue to study it, but many fear its potential to consume everything.
- The Infestation remains one of the few remnants of the Orokin Empire that still threatens the universe.
