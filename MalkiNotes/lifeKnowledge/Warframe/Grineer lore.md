# **Grineer Origins**

- The Grineer were once a faction of humans under the Orokin Empire, primarily used as soldiers.
- They were created through cloning, specifically designed to serve the Orokin.
- Over time, their genetic degradation became inevitable due to the cloning process.
- As the clones aged, their bodies began to deteriorate, and they became physically and mentally unstable.
- The Orokin, seeing the Grineer as disposable, abandoned them, leaving them to fend for themselves.

# **Grineer Society**

- Grineer soldiers are known for their fierce loyalty, even in the face of inevitable genetic degradation.
- The Grineer view themselves as the rightful rulers of the Origin System, often seeking to expand their empire by force.

# **Grineer Cloning**

- The Grineer are primarily a race of clones, each one genetically identical to the other.
- Cloning ensures a constant supply of soldiers, but it also leads to accelerated aging and physical degeneration.
- Their genetic degradation has made them heavily reliant on cybernetic enhancements to maintain function.
- The Grineer constantly try to restore their genetic purity, often resorting to unethical methods, including kidnapping and experimenting on others.
- Cloning technology is at the core of their society, though it’s a double-edged sword, as it contributes to their deterioration.

# **The Grineer Queens**

- The **Grineer Queens** are the supreme rulers of the Grineer Empire.
- They are the only individuals who retain untainted genetic purity, though they still rely on cloning.
- The Queens control the Grineer military, as well as their expansion efforts throughout the Origin System.
- They manipulate their empire through fear, subjugation, and their control of cloning technologies.
- Despite their power, the Queens are often seen as ruthless and cunning, using the Grineer military as pawns in their quest for domination.

# **Grineer Military**

- The Grineer military is vast, made up of clones, cyborgs, and various genetically modified soldiers.
- The **Grineer Lancers** serve as the foot soldiers, while higher ranks include **Grineer Heavy Gunners** and **Grineer Bombards**.
- Grineer forces are heavily augmented with cybernetics to combat their genetic degradation.
- The military is fiercely loyal to the Grineer Queens and operates in a strict, hierarchical structure.
- Military campaigns are usually focused on expansion, harvesting resources, and maintaining dominance over captured territories.

# **Grineer Technology**

- The Grineer have developed advanced but crude technology, often relying on brute force rather than finesse.
- Their **cybernetic augmentations** are vital for survival, as they compensate for their deteriorating bodies.
- They use **infestation-based technology**, experimenting with the Infestation to strengthen themselves, leading to bio-mechanical enhancements.
- The Grineer have a vast fleet of **ships**, many of which are industrial, designed for war and conquest.
- They utilize large, mobile **Fortresses** and **Factory Ships** to produce more clones and military resources.

# **Grineer Genetic Research and Experiments**

- Grineer scientists focus heavily on restoring their race's genetic purity through cloning and genetic experiments.
- They kidnap people from other factions, such as the **Corpus** or **Tenno**, in an attempt to obtain viable genetic material for experimentation.
- These experiments often lead to the creation of **Grineer Manics**, unstable and dangerous mutants, and other horrific bio-experiments.
- The Grineer are constantly seeking ways to improve their cloning process, but the issue of genetic decay remains unresolved.

# **Grineer Motivation and Goals**

- The Grineer’s ultimate goal is to restore their once-proud race and conquer the Origin System.
- They seek to expand their empire, wiping out all other factions, including the **Corpus**, **Tenno**, and **Infested**.
- The Grineer have little regard for life, often enslaving or exterminating other races to further their goals.
- Their obsession with genetic purity drives much of their aggressive expansion and their desire to dominate the Origin System.
- Despite their failings, they remain a formidable military force, and their drive for survival pushes them to constantly seek new methods of reproduction and genetic modification.
