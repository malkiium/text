[[Orokin lore]] [[Grineer lore]]
# **Kuva**

- A mysterious, highly potent substance created by the Orokin.
- Primarily used by the Orokin to grant immortality through the Continuity process.
- Fueled by the power of **the Void**, acting as a source of immense energy.
- Central to the Grineer Empire's survival and expansion.
- Holds powerful properties, including the ability to alter genetic structures and maintain life.

# **Kuva Origin**

- Created by the Orokin as a byproduct of their experiments with **Void energy**.
- Used in the Continuity process to extend life, most notably for the Orokin elite.
- The substance itself is tied to the **Void**, making it a source of unnatural power.
- After the Orokin’s fall, the **Grineer** sought to harness Kuva for their own means of survival.
- Kuva was also closely tied to the creation of **Kuva Liches** and **Kuva Siphons**, which are central to Grineer power.

# **Kuva and the Continuity Process**

- The Orokin used Kuva to power their **Continuity**, allowing them to preserve their consciousness and achieve near-immortality.
- Continuity allowed the Orokin elite to essentially "reset" their bodies, effectively preventing aging and death.
- Kuva acted as a crucial element in this process, providing the necessary energy to maintain their eternal rule.
- The **Kuva Fortress** remains a key place where Kuva is refined and stored, still operational under Grineer control.

# **Kuva and the Grineer**

- After the Orokin collapse, the **Grineer** took control of the Kuva resource, using it to maintain their race.
- The Grineer suffer from severe genetic degradation, and Kuva is used to slow or reverse their genetic decay.
- Kuva is crucial for the **Grineer Queens**, who use it to prolong their rule and retain genetic purity.
- The **Kuva Liches** are born from Grineer soldiers who undergo dark rituals to become infused with Kuva, turning them into powerful, immortal adversaries.
- The **Grineer** extract and refine Kuva from various sources, including **Kuva Siphons** and ancient Orokin facilities, to further empower their forces.

# **Kuva and the Tenno**

- The Tenno have a significant connection to Kuva, especially through their battles against the **Kuva Liches**.
- The **Tenno** are often sent on missions to disrupt the Grineer’s Kuva operations, preventing them from using the substance to further their empire.
- Kuva is also known to have a **corrupting** influence, as seen in the Kuva Liches, who are created from the merging of a Grineer soldier’s mind with Kuva.
- The **Kuva Fortress** serves as a focal point for Tenno missions, where they engage in battles against powerful Grineer forces to stop the spread of Kuva’s influence.

# **Kuva and Genetic Modification**

- Kuva has a unique property of enhancing or altering genetic structures, especially in the Grineer.
- The Grineer use Kuva to create more advanced and powerful soldiers, while also attempting to fix the flaws in their genetic makeup.
- Kuva plays a central role in the creation of **Kuva Liches**, who are genetically altered and infused with Void energy to grant them immortality.
- The Kuva-based modifications lead to the creation of more powerful forms of Grineer soldiers, capable of regenerating and even evolving.

# **Kuva Siphons and the Kuva Economy**

- **Kuva Siphons** are machines used by the Grineer to extract Kuva from the environment and other sources.
- The **Grineer Queens** utilize these siphons to harvest vast quantities of Kuva to maintain control over their empire.
- The **Kuva Floods** occur when large quantities of Kuva are released or extracted, often leading to Tenno interventions.
- Kuva extraction and manipulation have become a central part of the Grineer economy and military efforts.

# **Kuva’s Dark Influence**

- Kuva is inherently tied to **Void energy**, which has a corrupting effect on those who are exposed to it for too long.
- The **Kuva Liches** are an example of the corruption Kuva can cause, turning once-loyal Grineer soldiers into dark, power-hungry enemies.
- Overuse of Kuva or prolonged exposure can lead to madness, corruption, and the loss of individuality, which is why it is a highly sought-after but dangerous resource.
- The **Tenno** work to prevent the Grineer from using Kuva for mass production of these corrupted soldiers, attempting to end its cycle of influence.

# **Kuva’s Role in the Warframe Universe**

- Kuva serves as a central plot point in the ongoing conflict between the Grineer, Tenno, and other factions in the Origin System.
- It represents a **dark power** that can extend life but at the cost of moral decay, genetic corruption, and the loss of humanity.
- The Grineer’s obsession with Kuva has led to the creation of several advanced enemies, including the **Kuva Liches**, who are powerful adversaries for the Tenno to face.
- The substance’s Void origins hint at even deeper connections between the **Void**, the **Infestation**, and the **Tenno**, suggesting it is a key to understanding the true nature of the Warframe universe.
