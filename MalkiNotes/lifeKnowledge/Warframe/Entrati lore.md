# **Entrati**

- A powerful and influential Orokin family based on Deimos.
- Known for their obsessive study of the Void and the Infestation.
- Practiced genetic and mental manipulation, leading to their eventual mutations.
- Developed technologies to communicate with the Infestation and control it.
- Left behind a legacy of knowledge and experimentation, post-Orokin collapse.
# **Entrati Society**

- Formed a close-knit family dynasty, ruling Deimos before the fall of the Orokin.
- Led by the head of the family, with the members pursuing different scientific branches.
- Focused on Void experimentation, genetic alteration, and Immortality research.
- Lived in seclusion, hidden from the chaos of the Orokin downfall.
- Their way of life centered around scientific discovery, often pushing ethical boundaries.

# **Entrati and Orokin**

- Closely tied to the Orokin, but often seen as eccentric and detached.
- Their research into the Infestation and Void was deemed dangerous by the Orokin.
- Although not part of the ruling elite, their work was crucial for the Orokin’s experiments.
- Seen as both revered and feared, they were left mostly to their own devices.
- Continued their experiments even after the fall of the Orokin, adapting to the new chaos.

# **Entrati Way of Life**

- A family-driven hierarchy, with each member specializing in a different field of study.
- Obsessed with understanding the Void, Infestation, and the connection between both.
- Believed in transcending their mortal bodies by embracing the Infestation’s potential.
- Lived in harmony with Deimos, blending their technology with the organic Infestation.
- As their research evolved, so did their bodies, eventually mutating due to their experiments.

# **Entrati and the Infestation**

- Were among the few who sought to control and understand the Infestation.
- Studied how the Infestation could be used for genetic modification and life extension.
- Their knowledge of Infestation created a complex bond, blurring the lines between technology and biology.
- Eventually mutated into grotesque forms as a consequence of their experimentation.
- Became the "Infested" family, living in a symbiotic relationship with the Infestation on Deimos.

# **The Mutations of the Entrati**

- Over time, the Entrati family began mutating, their bodies warped by their own experiments.
- Each mutation reflected their area of research, with some becoming monstrous in appearance.
- The mutations, while physically distorting, gave them deeper connection and understanding of the Infestation.
- Despite their physical changes, they retained their intellect and leadership, though they became outcasts in the eyes of others.

# **Deimos and the Entrati**

- Deimos became the home of the Entrati after the Orokin collapse.
- The planet’s connection to the Infestation made it a sanctuary for their continued experiments.
- The family’s fortress, the **Entrati Family’s Capital**, was hidden beneath the surface, now a decaying relic.
- The planet’s ecosystem thrived in an eerie symbiosis between the Infestation and Entrati tech.
- They were one of the few factions unaffected by the fall of the Orokin, continuing to adapt and evolve.

# **Entrati and the Warframe**

- The Entrati family was deeply involved in the creation and understanding of Warframe technology.
- While not directly responsible for their creation, they influenced the technological understanding of Warframes.
- Their research into genetic manipulation and Infestation provided insight into how the Warframes were controlled.
- They studied how the Warframes connected to the Tenno, who were once controlled by the Orokin.

# **Entrati After the Fall of the Orokin**

- With the fall of the Orokin Empire, the Entrati family retreated further into isolation.
- Many of their experiments ended in failure, but they continued their work in secrecy.
- They maintained a hidden society on Deimos, continuing to monitor and manipulate the Infestation.
- With time, they became a more insular, infested people, feared by all who came into contact with them.
