- Whitebeard was a towering figure both in physical presence and reputation, and his crew, the Whitebeard Pirates, was one of the most powerful and loyal pirate fleets in the New World.

- **Advanced Haki:** Whitebeard was proficient in **Armament Haki** (for defense and offense) and **Conqueror’s Haki** (to assert his will over others). His Conqueror’s Haki was particularly potent, as it was able to exert dominance over foes and instill fear.

- **Creating a Pirate Family:** Unlike many pirates who sought power or treasure, Whitebeard’s main goal was to create a family of pirates. He took in orphaned or abandoned crew members, giving them a place in his pirate crew. This was exemplified by his crew members’ loyalty to him, which was not based on fear but on mutual respect and camaraderie.
- **Freedom:** Whitebeard lived for the idea of freedom, which was a core principle in his life as a pirate. His personal beliefs led him to create a world where his crew and family could live in peace without oppression, with no higher authority to control them.

- **Symbol of Loyalty and Family:** Whitebeard’s crew, particularly his sons, deeply mourned his death, with many of them vowing to honor his memory. The ideals of loyalty, honor, and family that he instilled in his crew became a guiding principle for many future pirates.
