# **Arlong: The Tyrannical Fish-Man**

- Arlong is a notorious fish-man who once ruled over the East Blue with an iron fist, striking fear into the hearts of countless people. His reign of terror was defined by oppression, racism, and a deep hatred for humans, which he used as a justification for his brutal rule.
- A former member of the Sun Pirates and a close ally of Fisher Tiger, Arlong's story is one of betrayal, vengeance, and ambition as he carved out his own path to power.
- His conflict with the Straw Hat Pirates, particularly with Nami, is one of the defining events of the crew's early journey, and Arlong’s actions had a lasting impact on both Nami’s past and the course of the Straw Hat Pirates' quest.

# **Arlong's Background and Rise to Power**

### **A Fish-Man with a Grudge**

- Arlong was born a fish-man, a race that historically faced discrimination and oppression at the hands of humans. This fueled his hatred for humanity, leading him to view all humans as inferior beings.
- Arlong’s resentment toward humans grew even more after the death of his mentor and the traumatic experiences he endured, including being betrayed by those who should have supported him. This led him to adopt a worldview that justified his cruelty toward humans.
- He was once a member of the **Sun Pirates**, a crew led by **Fisher Tiger**, a legendary fish-man who sought to liberate fish-men from human oppression. However, Arlong's ideals diverged from Fisher Tiger's, and he eventually abandoned the Sun Pirates to form his own crew.
- Arlong's hatred for humans and his ambitions to create a fish-man supremacist society led him to establish control over parts of the East Blue, where he terrorized local villages and took advantage of their helplessness.

### **The Arlong Pirates and His Tyranny**

- Arlong formed the **Arlong Pirates**, a crew of fish-men and other sea creatures who shared his brutal, supremacist beliefs. Under his rule, the Arlong Pirates seized control of several East Blue towns, extorting the locals for protection money and causing untold suffering.
- Arlong's cruelty was particularly evident in his actions against the village of **Cocoyashi**, where he forced the villagers to pay exorbitant fees in exchange for their safety. He used fear, intimidation, and his superior strength to maintain control over the area.
- One of Arlong’s most notorious actions was his manipulation and exploitation of **Nami**, a talented cartographer and navigator who was forced to work for him in order to save her village. This resulted in Nami’s emotional and psychological torment, as she was forced to carry out his orders against her will.

# **Arlong’s Conflict with the Straw Hat Pirates**

### **The Encounter with Nami**

- The most significant part of Arlong's story in _One Piece_ is his interaction with **Nami**. Arlong’s control over Cocoyashi Village forced Nami to serve him as his navigator, despite her deep hatred for him. Nami’s traumatic past, including the loss of her mother **Bellemere** at Arlong’s hands, shaped her desire to protect her village and her eventual decision to fight back against Arlong’s oppression.
- Arlong's cruelty is most evident in the way he undermines Nami’s dream. He forces her to work for him, constantly reminding her that her attempts to buy back her village were futile. Nami’s years of suffering under Arlong’s rule are central to her character development, and the eventual liberation of her village from Arlong’s grip marks a turning point in her journey.
- When Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates arrived in Cocoyashi Village, they took a stand against Arlong, marking one of the most pivotal battles in the early days of the crew. Luffy’s defeat of Arlong and the destruction of his base symbolizes the breaking of Nami's chains and the crew’s commitment to fighting against tyranny.

### **Arlong’s Defeat and Legacy**

- Despite his strength and ambition, Arlong’s reign came to a crashing halt when **Monkey D. Luffy** and the Straw Hat Pirates defeated him in battle. Luffy, driven by a desire for freedom and justice, refused to let Arlong continue his reign of terror over Nami’s village.
- After his defeat, Arlong was captured and handed over to the Marines. His downfall marked the end of his cruel rule, but it also signified the crew’s growing influence and the realization of Nami’s dreams of freedom.
- Though Arlong's defeat brought peace to Cocoyashi Village, his actions left a lasting scar on Nami. She was able to finally reclaim her village, but her memories of the suffering she endured under Arlong’s rule would forever shape her.

# **Arlong’s Personality and Motivations**

- **Arlong’s Hatred for Humans**: At his core, Arlong’s motivations were driven by his deep-seated hatred for humans. He viewed fish-men as the superior race and was determined to establish a world where they ruled over humans. This hatred was rooted in his traumatic past and the history of oppression faced by his kind.
- **Ambition and Arrogance**: Arlong's desire for power and his belief in fish-man supremacy made him arrogant and ruthless. He believed that his strength and status were enough to impose his will on others, leading him to take extreme measures to maintain control.
- **Cruelty and Manipulation**: Arlong’s cruelty was most evident in his treatment of Nami. He manipulated her dreams and forced her into submission, demonstrating his capacity for exploitation and emotional abuse. His disregard for the lives of others, especially humans, was a testament to his villainous nature.
- **Unyielding in Defeat**: Even in defeat, Arlong showed a stubborn refusal to accept his failure, often belittling others and clinging to his belief in fish-man superiority. This unyielding nature made him a dangerous and unpredictable foe, but it ultimately led to his downfall when he underestimated Luffy’s determination to protect his friends.

# **Arlong's Legacy and Influence**

- Arlong’s actions had a lasting impact on the world of _One Piece_, particularly through his relationship with Nami. His legacy is forever tied to the trauma he caused her, but also to the freedom she gained after his defeat.
- The fall of Arlong's tyranny also signaled a shift in the East Blue, as the people of Cocoyashi Village and other oppressed communities gained hope from the Straw Hat Pirates' victory.
- Though Arlong's influence as a villain is no longer felt directly, his legacy serves as a reminder of the harsh realities of oppression and the lengths to which the Straw Hat Pirates will go to protect their friends and their dreams.

# **The Ultimate Goal**

- Arlong’s ultimate goal was to create a fish-man-dominated world, where humans were subjugated under the might of fish-men. His vision was one of racial supremacy, rooted in his hatred for humanity and the years of oppression faced by fish-men.
- His dream was opposed by the ideals of Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates, who fought not just for their own freedom, but for the freedom of others to live without fear or oppression. Arlong’s defeat is symbolic of the crew’s refusal to allow tyranny to thrive, no matter the cost.

Arlong remains one of the most memorable and hated villains in the _One Piece_ series, serving as a catalyst for Nami’s growth and a reminder of the struggle against tyranny and oppression. His tragic backstory and eventual defeat highlight the ongoing fight for freedom in the world of _One Piece_.
