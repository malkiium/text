### **Monkey D. Dragon**

- Known as the **World's Most Wanted Man**, Dragon is one of the most feared and elusive figures in the world. He leads the **Revolutionary Army**, a group dedicated to overthrowing the **World Government** and bringing freedom to the oppressed people of the world.

### **Dragon’s Physical Strength and Abilities**

- **Unknown Devil Fruit Powers (Possibly)**: As of now, Dragon’s full abilities have not been revealed in detail. However, there are hints that he may possess a **Devil Fruit power**. His mysterious actions and abilities suggest that he might have a **weather-related Devil Fruit**, similar to the powers of **Enel** or **Vivi's mother** (who had a connection to weather manipulation). His introduction in the series showcases his immense presence and power, as he can command large storms and winds, but the exact nature of his abilities remains a mystery.
    
- **Leadership Skills**: Dragon is an incredibly charismatic and strategic leader, commanding the **Revolutionary Army** with tact and precision. His intelligence and foresight make him a formidable political figure, and his leadership has inspired countless others to join his cause against the oppressive **World Government**.
    
- **Great Combat Skill**: Though not much has been shown of Dragon’s personal combat abilities, his reputation suggests that he is highly skilled. As the leader of the **Revolutionary Army**, he is considered one of the strongest individuals in the world, and it is assumed he possesses great strength and combat prowess, even if it has not been showcased in battle extensively.
    

### **Dragon’s Role in the Revolutionary Army**

- **Overthrowing the World Government**: Dragon’s main goal is to overthrow the **World Government** and dismantle its corrupt system. He leads the **Revolutionary Army**, a global organization that seeks to end the tyranny and oppression enforced by the World Government.
    
- **Covert Operations**: Dragon operates in the shadows, organizing revolutions, gathering information, and building alliances with oppressed nations. His actions are often done in secret to avoid detection by the World Government, which views him as a major threat.
    
- **Influential Figures in the Revolutionary Army**: Many prominent figures serve under Dragon’s leadership, such as **Sabo**, **Koala**, and **Ivankov**. His army has been directly involved in several key revolutions, such as the overthrow of the **Kingdom of Dressrosa** and other significant battles against the World Government’s forces.
    

### **Dragon’s Relationship with Luffy and Garp**

- **Father of Luffy**: Dragon’s relationship with his son, **Monkey D. Luffy**, is rather distant, as they have not spent much time together. Dragon was absent during Luffy’s childhood, and Luffy is unaware of his father’s identity for much of the series. However, Luffy is shown to have inherited his father's rebellious spirit and strong sense of justice. Luffy’s journey as a pirate to become the **Pirate King** is a contrast to his father’s goal of liberating the world from tyranny, though they share a common enemy in the **World Government**.
    
- **Son of Garp**: Dragon is the son of **Monkey D. Garp**, the legendary Marine Vice Admiral. Despite Garp’s esteemed position in the Marines, Dragon went against his father’s expectations and chose a path of rebellion. This division within the **Monkey D. family** highlights Dragon’s deeply held beliefs about freedom and justice, which differ from his father’s adherence to the law.
    

### **Dragon’s Role in the World Government and Other Pirates**

- **A Major Antagonist to the World Government**: Throughout the series, Dragon is presented as a major antagonist to the **World Government**, aiming to dismantle the authority that has kept the world in a state of oppression. His actions and influence in shaping the course of history are key factors in the ongoing struggle between the **Revolutionary Army** and the **World Government**.
    
- **Relationship with Other Pirates**: Dragon’s relationship with pirates is not entirely clear. While he opposes the **World Government**, he is not directly involved in the world of piracy as Luffy is. His revolution focuses on toppling the establishment, and while he works alongside some pirates like **Luffy**, his main enemy is the **World Government** and its system, rather than individual pirates.
    

### **Dragon’s Legacy and Impact**

His goal is not just to liberate nations but to change the entire world order.
    

### **Dragon’s Ultimate Goal**

- **To Overthrow the World Government**: Dragon’s ultimate goal is to bring down the **World Government** and replace it with a system that promotes freedom and justice.
